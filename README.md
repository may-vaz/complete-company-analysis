# ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project presents a case study focused on **user gameplay and deposit data analysis** for a fictional company. The objective was to **calculate loyalty points**, **identify top users**, and generate **key business insights** to support reward allocation decisions.

## ðŸ§  Executive Summary  
In this analysis, I:

- Standardized column names for consistency  
- Converted time data into datetime format  
- Created two custom time slots:  
  - **Slot 1 (S1)**  
  - **Slot 2 (S2)**  
- Computed **Loyalty Points** for each user using a given formula and slot-wise weightages  
- Calculated loyalty points by:  
  - Specific **dates**  
  - Individual **slots**  
  - **Overall loyalty score** for October  
- Generated business insights including:  
  - **Average deposit amount**  
  - **Average deposit per user**  
  - **Average number of games played per user**

Based on the loyalty scores, the **top 50 users** were identified, and **bonuses were allocated** accordingly by the company.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Skills Used  

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** (for data wrangling & analysis)  
- **Datetime Handling**  
- **Business Logic Implementation**  
- **Descriptive Statistics**

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Outcomes  

- Accurate **loyalty point allocation** based on time slots and user behavior  
- Identified **high-value users** to assist in bonus reward strategy  
- Cleaned and **transformed data** to be analysis-ready  
- Delivered **actionable business metrics** for stakeholder use

## ðŸš€ Why This Project Matters  

This case study reflects a **real-world data task** where raw data must be cleaned, structured, and transformed into meaningful insights. It simulates the kind of work done in **Data Analyst** or **Business Intelligence** rolesâ€”supporting decisions that directly impact **customer engagement** and **revenue strategy**.
